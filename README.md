# STEM_clusteringShortTimeSeriesData

STEM is an acronym for the Short Time-series Expression Miner, a software program designed for clustering,
comparing, and visualizing gene expression data from short time series microarray experiments (8 time points
or fewer). STEM implements a novel method for clustering short time series expression data that can dierentiate
between real and random patterns. STEM is also integrated with the Gene Ontology (GO) [4] allowing ecient
biological interpretations of the data.
