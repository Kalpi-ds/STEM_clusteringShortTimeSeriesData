# STEM_clusteringShortTimeSeriesData

STEM is an acronym for the Short Time-series Expression Miner, a software program designed for clustering,
comparing, and visualizing gene expression data from short time series microarray experiments (~8 time points
or fewer). STEM implements a novel method for clustering short time series expression data that can differentiate
between real and random patterns. STEM is also integrated with the Gene Ontology (GO) allowing efficient
biological interpretations of the data.
